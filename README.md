# General Platform
I created this project for my porfolio.
It is a platform with two kind of users:
Business owners (like a resturant)
Per day employees

## Structure
Sign is as a business owners, with information about you and the business
Sign in as employee with information about you
The credential are then saved using a high level of securty
For a business owner is possible to search for possible employee and contact him/her or to post a job
The employee can search for jobs and apply to them
This is powered by a Firebase real time database.
